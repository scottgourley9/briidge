            <h3>Why Briidge?</h3>
            <p>In order to successfully become a franchise owner you need 3 things: Capital, Knowledge, Hustle. If you donâ€™t have either of these pieces you need to find them or partner with someone who has them. Most common is lacking capital or lacking an operating partner. We want to help briidge the gap between those two groups.</p>
